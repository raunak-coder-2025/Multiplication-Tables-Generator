# Multiplication Tables Generator

This Python script automatically generates multiplication tables from 2 to 20 and saves each table in a separate text file. It’s a beginner-friendly project to understand loops, functions, and file handling in Python.

## Features
- Generates tables from 2 to 20
- Uses functions and loops efficiently
- Demonstrates file handling in Python
- Saves each table in a clean `.txt` file

## How it Works
The script defines a function `generate_table(n)` which:
- Loops from 1 to 10
- Creates a formatted string for each line of the table
- Saves the table in a file named `table_n.txt` inside a `tables/` folder

## Example Output (table_5.txt)
```
5 × 1 = 5  
5 × 2 = 10  
5 × 3 = 15  
...  
5 × 10 = 50
```

## How to Run
Make sure a folder named `tables` exists in the same directory. Then run the script using:
```bash
python filename.py
```
All 19 table files will be created in the `tables/` folder.

## How to extract
Download and extract `tables.zip` to access all generated multiplication tables.
